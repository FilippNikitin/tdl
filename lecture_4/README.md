**This lecture:** 
All minima of wide-enough shallow sigmoid network are global (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/410380). 
Generalization to deep sigmoid networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08045).

[Slides](/lecture_3/Loss_landscape_part2.pdf) are the same as in the previous lecture, video will be available soon.

**Next lecture announcement:** 
Spin-glass model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0233, http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Choromanska15.pdf).
Eliminating local minima (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00279).

If we would have enough time:
gradient descent almost surely converges to local minima (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04915).
